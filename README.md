## About me

I am intreated in learning and develop more into data engineering and database management! I have a great understanding on how to analayze and manage data using **Python, R, SQL and Excel VBA.**


- Some of the projects that I have been doing lately is regarding web scraping Fanfiction data and store the data in a database. I have been using Redshift in AWS but also a PostgreSQL so I can try different approaches on each database.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **AWS, ETL**

## Dashboards made using R and Flexdashboards

The two links below are to dashboards created in **R** 👨‍💻 using the packages **Shiny and Flexdashboard**. I have a huge experience with creating dashbords with **Superset, Qlik and data studio**

### [Tweets about the Swedish Tax Agency, “Skatteverket”](https://pergranberg.shinyapps.io/skvtwitter1/)

One of my first workplaces was at the Swedish tax agency. I was intrested in extracting how the swedish people write about the tax agency, would it be with hate? love? satisfaction? scandals? 

I used Python and R in this project. Python was used to download around 42 000 old tweets that mentions “Skatteverket”, I was able to do this by using the package [GetOldTweets3](https://pypi.org/project/GetOldTweets3/) in Python.

I used R and the package Rtweet to download data from the official account of Skatteverket. Rtweet can download every tweet from a twitter account and was therefore perfect to use when analyzing the account of Skatteverket.

### [Figure Skating](https://pergranberg.shinyapps.io/testarskate/)

One of friends was active in figure skating and I noticed that he was on a [website](http://www.rinkresults.com/list-skaters) that have much data concerning multiple figure skating competitions and competitors. So I figured it would be fun to use Python to scrape the data and vizulise it in a dashboard. 

This project is very sentimental to me becuase it was the first one where I used Python to webscrape and I remeber how fun it was to see and collect data from a website! So this is where it all started ☺️


## Projects analyzing data with **R**
These are some of the procjects that I made some years ago in R. These projects bring back fun memories 


## Excel VBA projects
