## About me

I am intreated in learning and develop more into data engineering and database management! I have a great understanding on how to analayze and manage data using **Python, R, SQL and Excel VBA.**


- Some of the projects that I have been doing lately is regarding web scraping Fanfiction data and store the data in a database. I have been using Redshift in AWS but also a PostgreSQL so I can try different approaches on each database.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **AWS, ETL**

#### [Tweets about the Swedish Tax Agency, “Skatteverket”](https://pergranberg.shinyapps.io/skvtwitter1/)
One of my first workplaces was at the Swedish tax agency. I was intrested in extracting how the swedish people write about the tax agency, would it be with hate? love? satisfaction? scandals? 

I used Python and R in this project. Python was used to download around 42 000 old tweets that mentions “Skatteverket”, I was able to do this by using the package [GetOldTweets3](https://pypi.org/project/GetOldTweets3/) in Python.

I used R and the package Rtweet to download data from the official account of Skatteverket.Rtweet can download every tweet from a twitter account and was therefore perfect to use when analyzing the account of Skatteverket.


## Projects analyzing data with **R**
These are some of the procjects that I made some years ago in R. These projects bring back fun memories 


## Excel VBA projects
